Twp2019_df <- read_excel("Trash_Wheel_Collection.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)
  

Twp2018_df <- read_excel("Trash_Wheel_Collection.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation",  range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

Twp_df <- left_join(Twp2019_df, Twp2018_df, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name)
```
